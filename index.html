        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A JavaScript file ends with an extension of .js</l>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript you must declare the variable with the keyword [var]. Exmaple, var a = 1</li>
          <li>To print something to the colsole, we use the JavaScript command, [console()]. We can put text or a variable between the parentheses.</li>
          <li>In order to link the  .js file to the index.htrml file, we use the [script src="filepath.filename.js" /script] command</script></li>
          <li>The JavaScript file command listed above is placed below the /footer element a the bottom of the body element</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>For example: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name.</li>
          <li>This location is identified with a unique number called an index (or indeces, plural). Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <lio>Using the preivous example, shapes[0] is euqla to "traingle", shapes[1] is equal to "square", shapes[3] is equal to "circle"</lio>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. </li>
          <li>functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file run, you must call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
          <li>To Create a function, we use the function keyword folowed by (), parentheses</li>
          <li>The code to be run is within {} curly brackets</li>
        </ul>
